# VSDSquadron FM Research Internship by Ojasvi Shah
Understanding and Implementing the Verilog Code on the [VSDSquadron FPGA Mini Board](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/vsdsquadronfm/)

**Objective:** Understanding and documenting the provided Verilog code, creating the necessary PCF file, and integrating the design with the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini Board using the provided [datasheet](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/datasheet.pdf)

**Contents:**
1. Summary of [Verilog code](https://github.com/thesourcerer8/VSDSquadron_FM/blob/main/led_blue/top.v) functionality - found [here](https://github.com/ojasvi-shah/VSDSquadron-FM-Research-Internship-by-Ojasvi-Shah/blob/main/Verilog%20Functionality.md), including:

   a. purpose of the module

   b. description of internal logic and oscillator

   c. Functionality of RGB LED driver and its relationship to the outputs
   
3. Documentation of [PCF file](https://github.com/thesourcerer8/VSDSquadron_FM/blob/main/led_blue/VSDSquadronFM.pcf)'s pin mapping and explaination of the significance of each connection in context to the Verilog Code (as in 1) and board hardware

4. Integration steps and Observations while working with the FPGA Mini Board

5. Challenges faced and Solutions Implemented

6. Bibliography
